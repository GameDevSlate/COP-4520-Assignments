# COP-4520-Assignments

## How to run this program

‚ö†Ô∏è This only works for **Windows** systems. ‚ö†Ô∏è

Simply download the provided `.exe`* file provided in [x64/Release/](https://github.com/GameDevSlate/COP-4520-Assignments/tree/master/x64/Release) (or you can click the link, and download once inside the page). Once downloaded, you can simply click on the file to start the program.

### Command-line arguments

If you are going to run the program from a **windows** terminal, firstly, when you are inside the terminal and already in the directory of where the `.exe`* file is, you start by typing:

```
 .\COP-4520-Assignments.exe

```

You can simply press the ENTER key after that, and the program will start with no issues. If you want to immediately start at a particular assignment you type a space, *then* the **number** of the assignment you want to access. So, if you wanted to access assignment 1, you would type:

```
.\COP-4520-Assignments.exe 1
```

If you type a number outside the range of 1 to whatever the latest assignment due is, the program will default to using the assignment's menu inside the program.

\* ‚ö†Ô∏è The `.exe` was compiled for **64-bit** systems only. ‚ö†Ô∏è

## Compiling Binaries

‚ö†Ô∏è This project was coded using **ISO C++ 20 standard (/std:c++20)**, since it is the most stable at the moment. ‚ö†Ô∏è

### Visual Studio

‚ö†Ô∏è This only works if you have the *Visual Studio*, **not** Visual Studio Code. ‚ö†Ô∏è

Simply download the whole project and click on the `.sln` (solution) file, once Visual Studio opens, run the program.

üõë Set the build configuration to be **Release** if you want similar results to the provided `.exe` file.

### No IDE's, on a terminal

You only have to download the `src` folder, since that is what contains all source files require to run this program; from there, use your compiler of choice (g++, clang, etc.) and run its proper commands, note that I do not know the order of sequence all the files have to be in when typing the compile command.

‚ùóMight try to add makefiles at some point, but do not count on it.
